Hey, what's up. My name is Scott and this is a website I put together. It's a static page built using Jekyll, which is pretty cool even though I don't know shit about ruby. I based the theme on Spacetime, because it uses the paginate-multiple gem, which lends itself pretty readily to the blog/comic format. Then I took out all the stylish minimalist design and replaced it with <i>an abundance of blue.</i>
